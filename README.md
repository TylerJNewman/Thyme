# Thyme

TODO:

- When clicking a package render enough information about that package to be
  useful to a developer who is interested in that package
- Show the users who contributed to each package
- Clicking on usernames should open their profile page on GitHub

Expectations: use of the GitHub API and React. There’s a lot of data, don’t show
all of it, be selective for the UX and for your own time.

Within the project directory you'll find a `.env.local.thyme` file just rename
it as `.env.local`.
