# Tea Assement

Render a list of formula from Homebrew

- When clicking a formula render enough information about that formula to be
  useful to a developer who is interested in that formula
- Show the users who contributed to each formula
- Clicking on usernames should open their profile page on GitHub
- Add some flair

Expectations: use of the GitHub API and React. There’s a lot of data, don’t show
all of it, be selective for the UX and for your own time.
